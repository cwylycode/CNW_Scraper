## About
I was interested in seeing if I could get income and wealth data from celebrities and rich people. I found out about celebritynetworth.com and wrote this program to scrape and collect data from the website. Great backstory, I know.

## Contributions
This project won't be consistently maintained and I doubt I'll work on it further. It was mostly a coding exercise/idea.
