Coded by hexadeci-male.

## Install

Installation is done with PIP and can be done from GitHub, either as a Git install or a download/clone that you cd into. This package isn't available on PyPI, in case you were wondering.

**Note:** It's best to install this package in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) instead of your main system python because of potential dependency conflicts.

**Requires:** Python >= 3.8 & aiohttp 3.7.4.post0 + beautifulsoup 4.9.3 - See setup.py for full dependencies.

**Install from GitHub (you need Git):**
```
pip install git+https://github.com/hexadeci-male/CNW_Scraper.git
```

## About

I was interested in seeing if I could get income and wealth data from celebrities and rich people. I found out about celebritynetworth.com and wrote this program to scrape and collect data from the website. Great backstory, I know.

## Contributions

This project is not maintained and I doubt I'll work on it further. It was mostly a coding exercise/idea.
